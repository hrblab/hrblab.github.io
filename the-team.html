										<h3>Gavin Fox</h3>
										<p>Gavin is a current second year, social psychology PhD student with a focus on health psychology. Their research interests more specifically are in the domain of health promoting and health risk behaviors. Some of their previous work has examined parents’ intentions to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 using an extended Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). At the moment, they are engaged in research on the feasibility of a smartphone app for assessing college students’ context specific experiences in real time, and the extent to which these assessments can be used to predict drinking behaviors across time and people. Additionally, they are running a study examining the theoretical underpinnings of multiple health behavior change in order to create informed multiple behavior interventions that are more time and cost efficient than interventions targeting a single behavior alone. Outside of the lab, Gavin enjoys reading science fiction and fantasy novels, hanging out with friends, and collecting Pokemon cards. </p>
